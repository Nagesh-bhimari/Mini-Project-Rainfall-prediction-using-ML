# Mini-Project-Rainfall-prediction-using-ML
The primary objective of this research is to develop and implement an advanced predictive system for
accurate rainfall forecasting. The research aims to leverage machine learning models, including
Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to address the challenges
associated with unpredictable weather patterns.

### Advantages of the project
Water resources can be managed efficiently by using rainfall prediction system. 
 Regions can be evacuated if flood are expected. 
 It helps in taking appropriate measures to efficiently manage water resources, crop productivity and no wastage of any resources.

 ###  Proposed System:
The proposed rainfall prediction system employs a machine learning ensemble approach, integrating
XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms to enhance the accuracy
and reliability of rainfall forecasts. Utilizing historical weather data, including key meteorological
features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure, the system aims to
provide timely and precise predictions. The algorithmic diversity ensures comprehensive coverage of
different aspects of rainfall prediction, and a user-friendly interface facilitates easy interpretation by
meteorologists and decision-makers. The implementation plan involves data collection, preprocessing,
model training, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and real-time data integration, with the ultimate
goal of improving resource management, supporting agriculture, and enhancing disaster preparedness
through more informed decision-making.

###Result of the project:
1.This plot visualizes the relationship between 'Humidity9am' and 'Temp9am,' with points colored based on the 'RainTomorrow' variable,
providing insight into how these weather features relate to the likelihood of rain tomorrow. 

2. This plot visualizes the relationship between ‘mintemp' and ‘maxtemp,' with points colored based on the 'RainTomorrow' variable, 
providing insight into how these weather features relate to the likelihood of rain tomorrow.

###Conclusion:
The overall aim is to define various ML techniques that are useful in predicting rainfall. The goal of
this research is to design accurate and efficient model by applying lesser number of attributes and tests.
Firstly, the data is pre-processed and then it is used in the model. Random Forest classifier with
approximately 85.34% are the most efficient classification algorithms. However, Decision Tree
classifier gives the least accuracy with 78%. We can further expand this research covering other ML
techniques such as time series, clustering and association rules and other ensemble techniques. Taking
into consideration the limitations of this study, there is a need to build more complex and combination
of models to get higher accuracy for rainfall prediction system. Study can also be formulated using
greater articulate monitoring for particular area and create this kind of model for enormous dataset so
that calculation rate can be increased with better precision and with more accuracy
